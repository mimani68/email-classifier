12,"begin forwarded text Date: Wed, 25 Sep 2002 13:57:15 -0400 To: Digital Bearer Settlement List From: ""R. A. Hettinga"" Subject: California needs intelligent energy deregulation Sender: http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/4144696.htm?template=contentModules/printstory.jspPosted on Tue, Sep. 24, 2002 Dan Gillmor: State needs intelligent energy deregulationBy Dan Gillmor Mercury News Technology ColumnistThe facts were trade and government secrets at the time. But the energy industry failed the smell test in 2000 and 2001 as it tried to justify soaring wholesale electricity and natural-gas prices in California.Now, as investigators and regulators unravel the reasons for a financial and fiscal mess we'll be cleaning up for decades, we're learning what everyone suspected. Market games helped engineer the price spikes.The latest manipulation was highlighted in Monday's finding by a federal administrative law judge, who said a dominant natural-gas company squeezed supplies in order to squeeze customers. His ruling came a few days after California's Public Utilities Commission reported that electricity generators mysteriously failed to use available capacity during the crunch, also driving up prices.And don't forget the sleazy games by energy traders who gleefully worked the system, in schemes best summed up by an Enron insider's boast in a memorandum made public in May, that ``Enron gets paid for moving energy to relieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving any congestion.''How much of this was illegal, as opposed to simply amoral, remains to be seen. Unfortunately, California's response -- confusion, lawsuits and policy tweaks -- hasn't been sufficient.More unfortunately, even if the state suddenly did all the right things -- including a hard-nosed program designed to free ourselves from the gougers' grips -- we would need a willing federal partner. But it's foolish to think that the Bush administration would do much to help one of its least favorite states, or do anything that conflicts with its love of traditional, non-renewable energy sources.If the lawsuits against various energy companies and traders bear any fruit, the best we can expect is to pay off some of the massive debts the state amassed to prevent a total collapse in early 2001. That's a reasonable approach, but don't expect miracles.State policies are moving the wrong way on utility regulation, meanwhile. Instead of relentlessly pursuing smart deregulation -- still a good idea if it gives customers genuine choices -- state laws and regulations ``put the utilities back in the business of buying energy for captive customers,'' notes V. John White, executive director of the Sacramento-based Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies (www.ceert.org).It's tempting to call for an outright state takeover of the utilities -- tempting but a bad idea. When there's genuine competition, as we could achieve in electricity generation, the private sector tends to do a better job. Instead of abandoning deregulation, California should find a way to inject real competition into the market.We do need to recognize that the current system of delivering electricity defies privatization, at least under current conditions. Smart regulation is essential.But the best response to gouging is to use less of what the gougers control. There are two ways: conservation and replacement. We need more of both.The best recent step is a new state law that slowly but surely ratchets up the use of electricity from renewables. By 2017, California's utilities will have to get 20 percent of their power from solar and other renewable sources. Several power companies are expected to do this even sooner.But this law has an element of old-line thinking, the captive-customer model we need to be getting away from, not sustaining. Lip service to newer ideas isn't enough.The state should be removing barriers to micro-generation systems, small generators that can run on a variety of fuels and provide decentralized, harder-to-disrupt electricity to homes and businesses. This technology is coming along fast. State policies are not keeping pace.Investing to save energy is increasingly the smartest move of all. California should be doing more to encourage this, whether through tax incentives or outright grants in low-income households. California hasn't done badly on conservation in a general sense, and energy customers did react to last year's soaring rates and blackouts by cutting back, but it's lunacy to wait for the next crisis when we can do something to avoid it altogether.Maybe this is all pointless. The Bush administration's energy policies, so grossly tilted toward the unholy trinity of oil, coal and nuclear, are making us all more vulnerable. Never mind what might happen if the coming war in Iraq goes badly.It's pointless to hope for a sane federal policy -- a crash program to drastically speed the inevitable transition to a hydrogen-based energy system. But the largest state, one of the world's major economies in its own right, does have some clout. We can hit the rip-off artists where it hurts, and protect ourselves from even more serious disruptions. Maybe next year.-- ----------------- R. A.

support for legislation that will be center-stage in the next session.
This is an opportunity to ask your representative to take a stand for
your rights. Ask her/him to co-sponsor the DMCRA today!Representatives Rick Boucher and John Doolittle recently introduced
the Digital Media Consumers' Rights Act (DMCRA, H.R. 5544), which
would require labelling on usage-impaired ""copy-protected"" compact
discs and would make several several amendments to 1998's infamous
Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).Take action here:

2002"" (S. 2395, also known as ""the Biden Bill""). It started as an
attempt to stop organized crime from forging holograms and
counterfeiting money, but its scope has been greatly expanded to
include digital watermarks on copyrighted material. This is a sneaky
power-grab that would greatly diminish the rights of the public in
copyrighted works while expanding the power of copyright owners. It
goes well beyond the scope of current copyright law and could:~ Prevent universities, libraries, and consumers from enjoying the
exceptions to the Copyright Act adopted by Congress. S. 2935 could
prohibit the use of interface information essential for software
interoperability and competition~ Impose new responsibilities on Internet service providers and could
also require consumer electronics and computer manufacturers to
reconfigure their products.~ Impose more severe criminal and civil penalties than permitted by
the Copyright Act for identical behaviorThis ""anticounterfeiting"" bill is a decoy; stand up for your rights
today! Subscribe to the EFF Action Center and send your member of
Congress an email, letter or fax. You can take action by going to:http://action.eff.org/action/index.asp?step=2&item=2274Join EFF! For membership information see:
http://www.eff.org/support/-=end=-----------------------------------------------------------* Canadian Trademark Law OverreachingEFF has been involved in several cases involving overreaching
trademark claims on the Internet. Recently we have learned about a
Canadian lawsuit over the website www.lawsnet.com, a nonprofit legal
information website focusing on the laws of Canada and China that seem
especially egregious.Lawsnet.com is a free legal information website that has been
published since 1998. Last year, Lawsnet.com's owner Ling Xia was sued
by Quicklaw, a subsidiary of global publishing giant LexisNexus Group.
Quicklaw claims that Lawsnet.com violates its rights in the name
LAW/NET. However, LAW/NET does not have a public Internet website
under that domain name. The name appears on a subsidiary webpage of
the Quicklaw.com website that offers public ""teasers"" in the form of
summaries of recent Canadian cases, with the full text only available
through the private, proprietary paid Quicklaw service for Canadian
lawyers. It seems clear that the two names are substantially
different, are used in different places (one as a teaser for a closed
computer service and the other for information freely available on the
public internet) and are not causing any consumer confusion. Even more
problematic, Quicklaw does not even have a Canadian trademark in the
term LAW/NET -- it applied for one in 1997 but has repeatedly filed
requests for extensions of time with the Canadian trademark
authorities. In contrast, Ms. Xia is in the final stages of having a
Canadian trademark issued for ""lawsnet.""Regardless of its weak case, Quicklaw has managed to drag Ms. Xia
through over a year of litigation and recently succeeded in securing a
court order requiring her to undergo an extensive ""discovery"" process
that threatens to drive her under. Although she has had some free
legal assistance in the past, this next phase will require
significantly more legal resources than her volunteer attorneys can
muster. Quicklaw is represented by a large Toronto firm, Borden Ladner
and Gervais, LLP.Abuse of trademark law (even here, when no official trademark has even
been granted) is a growing problem on the Internet, and it is
unfortunately becoming an international problem. EFF urges Quicklaw,
and its US-based parent company, to stop beating up on this free and
useful website. While trademark law is important when misuse of a mark
is causing consumer confusion, it does not -- and should not -- grant
ownership in words, especially descriptive words like ""laws"" and ""net""
when describing an online legal information service. Trademark law
should also not be a license for large corporations who sell legal
information (or any other nonproprietary information) to stop
individuals who want to use the power of the Internet to provide free
legal information to the public.For those who wish to help Ms. Xia directly, local Toronto lawyer and
part-time law professor Gil Lan has agreed to act as trustee for a
legal defence fund to be established for Ms. Xia. If you wish to help,

30,"sle 31 call for papers , sle 31 , st andrews , scotland , 26-30 august 1998 workshop on modality in generative grammar the description and analysis of modality is of central interest to the study of human language . modality interacts with many subsystems of syntax and a better understanding of modality would further our understanding of these subsystems greatly . the relevant subsystems play a role in the existing analyses of the epistemic-deontic dichotomy . this has been attributed to : ( i ) argument structure ( e . g . ross 1969 ) : epistemic modals are one-place predicates ( corresponding to raising verbs syntactically ) , whereas deontic modals are two-place predicates ( corresponding to control verbs syntactically ) . ( ii ) insertion position : epistemic modals are generated in i , deontic modals in v ( e . g . picallo 1990 ) . ( iii ) lf position : epistemic modals are in c , deontic modals in vp ( e . g . mcdowell 1987 ) . ( iv ) nature of the complement of a modal : a definite verbal complement with epistemic modals and an indefinite verbal complement with deontic modals ( e . g . barbiers 1995 ) . v ) pragmatics : the dichotomy is contextually determined and does not correspond to a syntactic difference ( kratzer 1989 ) . many questions still need to be answered before a sufficiently adequate analysis can be developed . as for argument structure , it should be asked what evidence we have that each modal has two different argument structures . if such evidence exists , are these argument structures represented in the lexicon , as in theta-theoretic accounts , or only syntactically ? related questions concern the categorial status of modals ( a special category aux in english , but main verbs in german and dutch ) , the selectional restrictions they impose on their complement ( semantically uniform , but not syntactically : only verbal complements in english , no categorial restrictions in dutch , verbal and certain prepositional complements in german and afrikaans ) . as for their syntactic position at surface structure or lf , we need to know more about the ( scopal ) interaction of modals with negation . it is clear that there is a tight connection between modality and negation / affirmation : many languages have a modal that behaves as an negative polarity item ( english ` need ' , german ` brauchen ' , dutch ` hoeven ' ) . a related issue is the interaction of modals with focus particles , especially those that have a negative or affirmative import , such as english ` only ' or french ` bien ' . it seems that such focus particles can alter the syntactic and semantic behaviour of modals . the ( scopal ) interaction of modals with other quantifiers and modals with question operators is also in need of a better description and analysis . it has been claimed that question formation and epistemic modality exclude each other . although this does not seem to hold in general , question formation and epistemic modality do seem to restrict each other in ways that are poorly understood . the interaction of modal verbs with modal adverbials is also relevant for the determination of the syntactic position of modals , particulary in view of cinque 's ( 1997 ) hypothesis that every sentence contains two modal projections that must be either filled by a modal adverbial in the specifier or by a modal verb in the head . many languages have a construction with ` have to ' or ` be to ' that involves a modal interpretation . such constructions do not generally have an epistemic interpretation ( but consider english ` he was never to see her again ' , dutch ` het is te verwachten dat . . . ' ` it is to be expected that . . . ' ) . there are a great many cross-linguistic peculiarities on this point , which are worth exploring . for example , one question is how this type of construction , lacking a visible modal element , yields a modal interpretation . there is a more general question concerning modality : which properties of modals are necessary for modality and which are accidental ? cross - linguistically , modals often have a irregular present tense inflection paradigm . it is unclear whether this is a necessary property of modals and if so , why . the fact that english modals are auxilaries but modals in other languages are not is presumably an accidental property , and so is the fact that english modals lack infinitives and participles in their paradigm , whereas dutch modals do have infinitival and participial forms ( except for the verb ` zullen ' ` will ' ) . as it seems that the bulk of generative studies of modality involves germanic languages , we particularly invite papers on modality in romance and central european languages . organizers : sjef barbiers ( leiden ) , frits beukema ( leiden ) , olga tomic ( novi sad ) , milena milojevic sheppard ( ljubljana ) , marija golden ( ljubljana ) . please submit abstract ( 1 a4 max ) to : professor olga miseska tomic bulevar avnoja 109 / iii , stan 16 beograd yu 11070 yugoslavija e - mail : efilb01 @ yubgss21 . bg . ac . yu & dr sjef barbiers hil / department of dutch studies p . n . van eyckhof 3 leiden , nl 2300 ra the netherlands e - mail : barbiers @ rullet . leidenuniv . nl & dr frits beukema hil / department of english p . n . van eyckhof 4 leiden , nl 2300 ra the netherlands e - mail : beukema @ rullet . leidenuniv . nl closing date for submission of abstract : 15 may 1998 date of acceptance / rejection of abstract : 1 july 1998",Safe Email

33,"release of agfl home page this message announces the release of the world wide web home page of agfl ( affix grammars over a finite lattice ) . 1 . agfl the agfl formalism , developed at the university of nijmegen , the netherlands , is a formalism in which context free grammars can be described compactly . agfls are two level grammars : a first , context free level is augmented with features for expressing agreement between parts of speech . features are treated as types , and their values may range over the subsets of a given finite set , which explains the acronym affix grammars over a finite lattice . agfl grammars are transformed into a parser by the parser generator opt . the generated parser is a recursive backup parser which computes the values of the affixes on the fly . in this way , fast and efficient parsers can be generated . the formalism is quite simple and limited , and therefore easy to read and write . agfl comes with a grammar workbench gwb , supporting the development of grammars and the checking of their consistency . the agfl formalism does not require any special hardware . the parser generator opt runs on regular sparc - systems and ms-dos machines ( 386 or higher ) and is relatively small . for instance , the ms-dos version requires less than 1 mb harddisk space . 2 . agfl on the web agfl has now been made available to the ( computational ) linguistic community . we think it can be used by ( computational ) linguists who are in need of a simple grammar formalism with a fast parser generator , suitable for experimental purposes . therefore , we have made agfl available via ftp and , recently , via www . the agfl home page contains information about the agfl formalism like the agfl manual , documentation and papers , sample grammars and the latest developments . there is also the possibility to download the software and to register yourself as an agfl user . you are invited to take a look at the home page and to read the information or to download the software . please feel free to make use of agfl and its home page ; we look forward to hear about your experiences . we are currently planning an agfl workshop in june . the latest news about this workshop can also be found on the agfl home page . the url of the agfl home page is : http : / / www . cs . kun . nl / agfl / the address of the ftp - site is : ftp : / / hades . cs . kun . nl / pub / agfl / the organisation of the www page should be self-explanatory . the structure of the ftp - site is as follows : - readme - doc : this directory contains a number of relevant papers - pc386 : this directory contains software for ms-dos machines and an installation guide . - sun4 : this directory contains software for sparc - stations and an installation guide . any questions or remarks with respect to agfl or the agfl home page can be sent to : www-agfl @ cs . kun . nl . on behalf of the agfl team , erik oltmans department of computer science university of nijmegen the netherlands",Safe Email

38,"Thanks Brent: now it's clearer (to me) what's needed. I've used the global
sort and J C Lawrence's re-scan, but there is still a vulnerability there:
If I have an instance of exmh running, the folder I'm visiting will have
its new, correct .xmhcache overwritten with an incorrect one when I switch
folders. I can cron the sort and re-scan process, but I should kill running
exmh's first.Best would be to have a button for ""Global sort and update all scan caches""

39,"re : 6 . 381 words that are their own opposites several people submitted "" overlook "" and "" oversight "" , which are fine examples of this phenomenon in english ( though i think that mary neff 's "" outgoing : retiring "" is perhaps the most elegant submission to date . ) perhaps my current work on the various shades of meaning in english prepositions has biased me , but in any case i think that the difference in the various senses of "" oversight "" and "" overlook "" stems largely from their compounding with "" over - "" . "" over "" is sneaky ; at first glance it seems to be fairly limited in expressive power , but deeper analysis reveals that in it lurk a number of distinctions of meaning , some of them quite subtle indeed . in addition to nuances of physical location , "" over "" can indicate power relationships ( both outright force , and more subtle authority ) , value judgements , and the general notion of ( metaphorically ) moving on to another thing , as in "" get over it "" and "" skip over "" . so my analysis of "" oversight "" and "" overlook "" would be that in one sense , "" over "" takes on the meaning of authority-over , and in the other sense it takes on the meaning of skipping-over . perhaps a similar argument could be make for the "" sight / see / look "" part of the compound ? for instance , useages such as "" see to it "" "" look to your own interest "" seem to carry some of this "" authority "" meaning . i think the "" over "" analysis is more clear-cut , but it would be interesting to see if someone will make a case for the other half . - - marion kee marion kee | all opinions are my own ; knowledge engineer , center for machine translation | when cmu wants my opinions carnegie mellon university pittsburgh , pa , usa | it pays for them .",Safe Email

  TP> headers.I tried the ""Anthony"" stuff, but it didn't make any appreciable
difference that I could see from staring at the false negative rate.
The numbers are big enough that a quick eyeball suffices.Then I tried a dirt simple tokenizer for the headers that tokenize the
words in the header and emitted like this ""%s: %s"" % (hdr, word).
That worked too well :-).  The received and date headers helped the
classifier discover that most of my spam is old and most of my ham is
new.So I tried a slightly more complex one that skipped received, data,
and x-from_, which all contained timestamps.  I also skipped the X-VM-
headers that my mail reader added:class MyTokenizer(Tokenizer):    skip = {'received': 1,
            'date': 1,
            'x-from_': 1,
            }    def tokenize_headers(self, msg):
        for k, v in msg.items():
            k = k.lower()
            if k in self.skip or k.startswith('x-vm'):
                continue
            for w in subject_word_re.findall(v):
                for t in tokenize_word(w):
                    yield ""%s:%s"" % (k, t)This did moderately better.  The false negative rate is 7-21% over the
tests performed so far.  This is versus 11-28% for the previous test
run that used the timtest header tokenizer.It's interesting to see that the best descriminators are all ham
discriminators.  There's not a single spam-indicator in the list.
Most of the discriminators are header fields.  One thing to note is
that the presence of Mailman-generated headers is a strong non-spam
indicator.  That matches my intuition: I got an awful lot of
Mailman-generated mail, and those lists are pretty good at surpressing
spam.  The other thing is that I get a lot of ham from people who use
XEmacs.  That's probably Barry, Guido, Fred, and me :-).One final note.  It looks like many of the false positives are from
people I've never met with questions about Shakespeare.  They often
start with stuff like:> Dear Sir/Madam,
> 
> May I please take some of your precious time to ask you to help me to find a
> solution to a problem that is worrying me greatly. I am old science studentI guess that reads a lot like spam :-(.Jeremy

64,"closing linguistics at soas call for help ! ! ! soas department of phonetics and linguistics to be closed in october 1992 dear colleagues , on tuesday may 19 , dr david bennett , head of our department , was told that we would cease functioning as of october of this year . we are a department of the school of oriental and african studies of the university of london . the members of our department are : dr david bennett prof thea bynon dr wynn chao dr monik charette dr katrina hayward dr richard hayward * dr george hewitt * * dr bruce ingham prof jonathan kaye prof ruth kempson * cross appointed with the africa department * * cross appointed with the near and middle east department our department offers degrees at the ba , ma , mphil and phd level . approximately 60 students , mostly at the postgraduate level are enrolled . many other students , particularly from university college , london ( ucl ) take courses with us . we run an ma - linguistics and an ma - phonetics programme jointly with ucl . we also have an ma in english - arabic applied linguistics and translation together with birbeck college . all these programmes will of course be affected by this decision . the department of phonetics and linguistics is the oldest linguistic department in the u . k . it was the home of the "" london school "" which received worldwide attention under the intellectual leadership of prof jr firth . his chair , which i occupy today , was the first chair of linguistics in the u . k . over the years our graduates have distinguished themselves in many areas of linguistics . later postings will provide a partial list of the more well known soas graduates . it is acknowledged , even by the administration of soas , that we remain a centre of academic excellence in our field . the decision to close the soas linguistics department was made with no consultation , no advanced warning . it was a result of discussions by the governing body of the school , the finance and general purposes committee and the management committee . there is no linguistic representation on any of these bodies . the reasons given for closing the department are : ( 1 ) severe budget cuts ( 2 ) our low number of undergraduate students ( 3 ) the "" general perception "" that our department is not well integrated into the school . it was stated that , among the options considered closing our department would cause the "" least harm "" to the school . no one was present to represent the linguistics side of the story . this decision will be presented to the academic board of the school on wednesday may 27 . the academic board has an advisory role only but we are hoping to mobilise school opinion against this decision . unlike similar cases in other countries , most of the members of our department will not be redeployed elsewhere in the school . recent legislation has virtually destroyed the notion of tenure in the u . k . many of us are facing "" premature retirement "" , "" redundancy "" or some form of "" severance "" agreement . the administration of the school seems to feel that we will easily find jobs and that terminating our employment at the school will cause us no undue hardships . given the administration 's figures for the cost of severing their relation with us , the offers that we are likely to receive from the school will not be very attractive . as of now , no statement has been forthcoming about our future at the school but the director has stated that he will be meeting with us individually next week . we will keep you posted on this aspect . if you would like to do something to try and help us stop the closing of our department , please send ( in order of preference ) a fax or a letter to me at the address and fax number given below . if possible use your institution 's letterhead . please feel free to make comments about our department as a whole or about individual members with whose work or reputation you are familiar . pass this message along to your colleagues and encourage them to write as well . if you feel so inclined , departmental resolutions reflecting your opinion of this event would be quite helpful . i hope to be able to arrive at next wednesday 's meeting with an armful of your letters ( copies of all letters will be sent to our director ) and your support will do a lot to improve our spirits . this will be a long and difficult struggle both for our department and for our jobs and careers . thank you in advance for listening and for your support . jonathan kaye professor of general linguistics department of phonetics & linguistics school of oriental and african studies thornhaugh street , russell square london , wc1h 0xg u . k . e-mail : jk @ ukacrl . earn jk @ uk . ac . rl . ib ( janet ) fax number : ( 44 ) + 71-436 - 3844",Safe Email

71,"Looks and sounds a hell of a lot like Clare's cat, Violence...A tall tail or is it a prowling panther?
http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/weird/display.var.633939.Bizarre+London.0.html
Security cameras at the Gardiner house filmed the cat
The Plumstead panther has been spotted just yards from the scene of a 
sighting made three weeks ago but this time it was caught on camera.Steve Gardiner, 41, claims to have spotted the large cat in his garden in 
Upton Road, Plumstead, in the sixth reported sighting in Woolwich and Bexley 
in just four weeks.Mr Gardiner told News Shopper he watched the big cat as it walked alongside 
the house at about 7.15am, on Wednesday, September 25, while his security 
cameras captured it on film.The father-of-four described the black cat as about 3ft long and 
two-and-a-half-foot high, with a large body.He said: ""It prowled past the patio doors moving with all the mannerisms of 
a hunter.""It looked at me calmly before moving on.""The bricklayer told how his work colleagues let him know News Shopper had 
been following the big cat story so he decided to call our offices with news 
of the sighting.His wife, Karen, 41, later checked the tape which had captured grainy images 
of the large cat prowling through their garden.She said: ""I feel sorry for it not living in its natural habitat I'd hate 
for it to get hurt.""Mr Gardiner told how he is convinced of the cat's existence saying how their 
usually quiet 18-year-old dog barks at ""nothing"" in the garden but barked 
that morning.He warned: ""I don't think these cats are dangerous but, if cornered, they 
might jump you.""Sightings of the large black cat are being reported all over the Plumstead 
Common and Shooters Hill as well at the Bexley area.If you have seen the big cat, call News Shopper on 01689 885712.12:27 Tuesday 8th October 2002_________________________________________________________________

75,"re : 5 . 1237 sum : basic word order ( and remarks on typology ) fritz newmeyer raises some important issues about typological research as instantiated in nichols ' work and elsewhere , which call for some comments . first , the notion of language type is an idealization : this is often made clear in typology courses , where non-existent artificial languages are considered as logically possible or impossible language types , if not always in the published literature ( though the point is clearly made in comrie 's textbook , for example , by the discussion of morphological typology ) . similarly , fritz is quite right to point out that the assumption of no areal or genetic bias , to the extent that it is made at all , is a counterfactual one . what i would ask is whether such idealizations differ in kind from those , many of them counterfactual , which underlie generative grammar . the justification is similar in both cases : methodologically , one cannot deal with all the relevant variables all the time , and some of the concepts used are logically independent of the extrinsic variables , e . g . one can investigate consistency with proposed implicational universals regardless of the statistical bias in one 's sample . the term ` shaky typological pigeon-holing ' is particularly inapt as applied to nichols ' distinction between head-marking and dependent - marking languages , which is quite explicitly a matter of degree ( see her 1986 paper where the degree of hm vs . dm is quantifified in terms of the number of patterns instantiating each type ) . if nichols refers to a ` head-marking language ' this is shorthand for a quantifiable tendency , just as we might describe italian as a ` pro-drop language ' without implying that there is a binary distinction here ( in fact there are degrees of pro-drop , e . g . some languages allow null expletives but not null referential subjects , etc ) . another point which i think all typologists would accept is that languages which do n't appear to match an established type are typological data - for example , colloquial french as discussed recently on linguist is a language which might reasonably be described as having no basic word order ( i believe that nichols classified it as vso in one of her tables , but that is again shorthand for a more complex situation ) . this is an explanandum for which nichols ' 1986 paper offers an explanation : head-marking facilitates word order freedom , and colloquial french instantiates clausal head-marking in nichols ' sense . to sum up : pace widespread opinion , typologists ' goal is not pigeon-holing ( "" taxonomy "" is also widely used in this context ! ) but the investigation and explanation of patterns of variation . steve matthews",Safe Email

Some interesting quotes...http://www.postfun.com/pfp/worbois.html
Thomas Jefferson:""I have examined all the known superstitions of the word, and I do not
find in our particular superstition of Christianity one redeeming feature.
They are all alike founded on fables and mythology. Millions of innocent
men, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been
burnt, tortured, fined and imprisoned. What has been the effect of this
coercion? To make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites;
to support roguery and error all over the earth.""SIX HISTORIC AMERICANS,
by John E. Remsburg, letter to William Short
Jefferson again:""Christianity...(has become) the most perverted system that ever shone on
man. ...Rogueries, absurdities and untruths were perpetrated upon the

Is there a relatively clean way to dynamically build comp files based on
the path of the current folder?  Yeah, I know exmh will pull the first comp in the path up from the
  current folder to the mail root, but that's not what I want.I'm starting to use plus addressing heavily as part of my SPAM controls.
Specifically I each mailing list with a list-specific address.  eg I would subscribe to this list as claw+exmh@kanga.nu or perhaps
  claw+exmh-users@kanga.nu instead of claw@kanga.nuHowever to do this I need a new set of comp files for each list folder.
As I'm subscribed to something just over 600 lists, that's rather a
pain.  I really don't want to go create and maintain ~1,800 comp files
(components, replcomps, replgroupcomps), especially not as I suspect
I'll be changing or adapting my naming pattern a few times as I adapt
various supporting tools.What would be great is if I could build the relevant comp file
dynamically at runtime.  That way I don't need to maintain a couple
thousand comp files, I just need to make my plus addresses
predictable/computable based (say) on the folder path.  eg I'm currently in folder:    +-Lists-/Products/Exmh-L    The script would dynamically build a compfile which had a From: of
    claw+exmh@kanga.nu for repl, comp, etc.  Similarly when in folder:    +-Lists-/Linux/SVLUG-L  I'd get a From: of claw+svlug@kanga.nuThat way I can use lookup tables for those folders which have multiple
lists being delivered into them.Any ideas how this might be done in an automatic/maintainable fashion?
It would be more than good enough if all I had to do was drop a tiny
FROM_HEADER file in each folder that somehow got picked up by the comp
file...--

This is remarkable for its lack of newsworthiness.1) Bletchley Park used optical sensors, which were (and still are) the best way to read paper tape at high speed.

bytecodes.  That font is ""QuickType II"", grabbed off my Windows

Date: Not suppliedA San Francisco cabbie -- generally a well-educated and firm-opinion-holding 
class of person -- has an essay about a subject near and dear to my 
(non-car-owning) heart: Why is it so damned hard to get a cab in San Francisco? 
    In fact, no cab company ever tells a driver to pick up anyone. When you 
    phone a cab firm in San Francisco, your call is treated not as an order, 
    not as a binding oral contract, but simply as a request...     So, why don't cab companies ensure that we pick you up on time-or at all? 
    In a nutshell, labor law states that if a cab company actually commands a 
    driver to carry out a specific action, that constitutes an 
    employer-employee relationship. But if a company farms its work out to 
    independent contractors, it can rid itself of costly expenses such as 
    disability and social security taxes. It also means that the contractor 
    drivers can't unionize.  Link[1] Discuss[2] (_via CamWorld[3]_)[1] http://www.bradnewsham.com/articles/why_so_hard.shtml

 Dear readers,The majority of PC users may run Windows, but Microsoft can't
touch the passion that Mac users bring to computing. This week,
Apple devotees gathered in New York to find out what their guru,
Steve Jobs, has in store for them. They were not disappointed,
with offerings ranging from the new iMacs, which continue to push
the boundaries of the PC form factor, to updated iPods that
include more memory, better menus, and compatibility with
Windows. Read the 
full coverage from

PIMs on the side
Whatever happened to the straightforward, dedicated PIM?
   PIM/contact managers, such as the ubiquitous Outlook and
   Lotus, pushed them to the sidelines. But a few PIMs survived
   this enforced obscurity. If you need a plain PIM that doesn't
   cost a fortune, one of these may tickle your fancy.

More in wireless phonesÂ Readers mourn Gene Kan
Peer-to-peer pioneer dies, Macworld kicks off in Manhattan, and
the PayPal/eBay merger is not going so well.--Laura Lindhe, executive editor, CNET Tech Trends
1
Gene Kan:   Gnutella open-source guru Gene Kan, who died on June
   29 in an apparent suicide, was clearly beloved by the CNET
   community. Last week, search requests for information on
   25-year-old Kan far outweighed the kind of requests on
   products and companies I usually see. A pioneer in the
   peer-to-peer space, many credit him with legitimizing file
   sharing--making it about more than music, according to Wired
   News.
2
Macworld:   The annual Apple lovefest in New York is always a
   good show, whether or not Steve Jobs has anything real to
   announce. So far, it looks like Apple has already surprised a
   few by announcing the release of QuickTime 6.0 (see No. 7),
   which many thought would get bogged down in a licensing
   quagmire.
   3
PayPal:
   
   It's been a rocky road thus far for the eBay and
   PayPal deal. Soon after eBay announced it was buying PayPal

Wi-Fi:   I'm just going to leave this common term for 802.11 up
   on the Buzz Meter permanently. This time, Wi-Fi is getting
   interest because of a possible pact between tech heavyweights,
   including Intel, AT&T Wireless, and Verizon Communications, to
   build wireless access places across the nation in public areas
   where people would want to launch onto the Net, such as
   airports.

eMac:   This is the for-education-only computer that consumers
   wanted so badly that Apple released it to them. The CNET
   review is out, and here's the word: the eMac is what the iMac
   used to be. Basically, it's an easy-to-use, fairly inexpensive
   computer for users who don't need to do much besides word
   processing and accessing the Web.

Float:Â Â  5 MillionInsider & Institutional Holdings:92% SharesÂ Â Â "" CXIN MEDIA CORPORATION, THE BLOOMBERG OF CHINA."" - Finance and Investment Magazine, December 2001Â THE COMPANY:CXIN Media Corporation is an integrated media company focusing on the dissemination and aggregation of information. Currently, CXINs core business is in the publishing and aggregation of Financial, Economic, and Business Information on the Peoples Republic of China. The value CXIN Media provides is its ability to source, package, and present information that is highly in demand by the market.Apart from the core print and electronic publishing business, CXIN is involved in other related businesses, such as organizing and managing events such as conferences, seminars, and training in the field of wealth management and personal finance.These areas are closely linked to the core competencies of the company and they intend to leverage on the brands that they have built to further drive the growth potential.CXIN holds the key to success in the Peoples Republic of China. In May of 2001 they acquired the 12 year exclusive right from the China Economic Information Network, a corporation under the direct management of the State Information Center and the State Planning Development Commission, Chinas highest economic decision body.HIGHLIGHTS:May 2001, CXIN acquires the 12 year Exclusive license to distribute all information in English, French and Spanish, Internationally.February 2002, CXIN announced its first distribution contract with a leading market research provider.March 2002, CXIN announces it had signed with yet another distributor for its unique financial , economic and business information on the Peoples Republic of China.Â May 7, 2002, CXIN announces a distribution agreement with Internet Securities, a Euromarket company and the leading provider of emerging market securities.May 9, 2002, CXIN announces it had hired one of Asias top media consulting firms, Telesis, and its President, Mr. Cyril Pereira, the former Director of Operation of the South China Morning Post and Asia Magazine.June 12, 2002, CXIN launched its China Business portal and began selling subscriptions.June 24, 2002, CXIN announces the acquisition ofÂ  Smart Investor Magazine and related business. This magazine will bring over $1.2 Million in consolidated revenues.Â July 15, 2002, CXIN announces the license agreement with Lexis-Nexis, one of the worlds largest aggregators.INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS:According to the reports from Morgan-Stanley, which analyzes the worlds superpowers in 11 industries, it only takes 8 years to build a media empire, which means the return on investment in this industry will be far greater than that of pharmaceutical, household merchandise, energy, or even banking. We believe that CXIN Media is well positioned to become the next superpower of the media market in the fast growing Chinese market. The superior management and its exclusive agreement granted by the Chinese government provide the company with an ""unfair advantage"" over its potential competitors. We believe that the recent license agreements signed with some of the largest information providers in the world as well as the Smart Investor Magazines and related business will enable the company to meet its revenue and profit expectation of $50 Million within the next 5 years and dependent on market condition for refinancing, we foresee that CXIN Media could easily double their expected revenue and profits through strategic acquisitions. The current price of the shares do not reflect the value of this growth company, in comparison to the sector CXIN Media should be currently trading between $0.25 to $0.50 and above this value when we take into consideration the growth factors.Disclaimer: The Wall Street Weekly provides information on selected companies that it believes has investment potential.

With due respect and humility I write you this letter which I believe you
would
be of great assistance to my children and I.
I got your contact through my husband commercial address book and believed
that
you must be a trust worthy and reliable person that will not like to
intimidate me
or betray my trust after hearing this news. I am a native of KONOBO in the
KEREMA
local district of SIERRA LEONE in West Africa and the wife of Late DR.
MUNDI A.
KOJO who was assassinated by the rebel forced loyal to Major John Paul
Koromah
because he was the Director General National Gold and Diamond Mining
Corporation
of Sierra Leone. Few days before my husband was assassinated, he 
instructed me
and my children (Ibrahim and Amina) to move out of Sierra Leone immediately,
before the powerful Economic community of West African States (ECOMOG)
forces
intervened, which eventually resulted into a brutal civil war. My children
and I
managed to escape to Togo through the help of my husband's friend. We came
into
Togo with some valuables including a cash sum of $25MILLION(TWENTY FIVE
MILLION
UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY) in two trunks boxes which I have deposited
with a
Trust Company here in Togo and special arrangement has been made with the
currier
company who will freight the money to your country.
Meanwhile, I want to leave Togo entirely with this money for investment in
your
country because of a stable political situation there and mostly for the
future of
my children. I want you to please assist us to claim this fund from the
Trust
Company in any of their branches in Europe, after which the fund will be
deposited
into your account for investment in your country. You should also help us to
source for good investment opportunity so that we can invest wisely in your
country when the fund is finally confirmed in your account.
We have it in mind to reward you handsomely for your assistance as we have
resolved to give you 20% of the total sum for your help. But due to how I
am being
monitored by the Sierra Leonean Government Secret Agents, I will advice
you to
have the 
deal concluded with my son (IBRAHIM KOJO). Please contact my son on this
email:
ibrahimkojo@caramail.com , immediately you receive this letter to enable us
proceed in earnest towards retrieving the consignments and transferring
same into
your account.
Your private Fax and Phone is needed in this transaction for private
discussions.

168,"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,781616,00.htmlBritons stand tall, if slightly heavy, in EuropeJohn Carvel, social affairs editor
Wednesday August 28, 2002
The GuardianNot every European dimension has been harmonised in Brussels yet. According
to the Department for Trade and Industry, the average Briton stands head,
shoulders, girth and bottoms above their continental partners.
The figures come in a new edition of the department's handbook of
anthropometric and strength measurements, compiled by ergonomists at the
University of Nottingham to help manufacturers design products to fit
people's shape.
The volume provides 294 measurements ranging from the distance between the
inner corners of the eyes to the length of the leg between the crease below
the buttock to the crease at the back of the knee.
It has discovered that the average British man is 36 millimetres (1 inches)
taller than his French counterpart.
The mean height of UK citizens is 1,755.1mm (5ft 9in). Among European men
only the Dutch are taller, averaging 1,795mm and with a clear height
advantage over the US men's average of 1,760.4.
The average British woman is 1,620mm tall (just under 5ft 4in), compared
with 1,604mm for her French counterpart, 1,610mm for the Italians and
1,619mm for the Germans. Swedish women average 1,640mm, Dutch 1,650mm and
Americans 1,626.7mm
More disturbingly, British men and women are heavier than all the other
nationalities except the Americans, averaging 79.75 kilos for British men
and 66.7 for women.
The average British woman has a chest measurement of 1,007.8mm (39.7
inches), compared with 965mm for the Italians, 912.6mm for the Japanese and
806mm for Sri Lankans. American women also top this scale with an average of
1,047.2mm.
The average British woman's waist is 840.6mm (33 inches) - also second
largest behind the Americans. But her bottom at 873.7mm is considerably
smaller than the Italians at 916mm who beat the Americans into second place.
The average British male foot is 266.8mm long (10.5 inches), 6mm longer than
the French and Germans, 3mm more than the Italians and 1mm more than the
Swedes. But they are just beaten by the Americans at 267.8mm and massively
outstripped by the Dutch at 275mm.
However Dutch women have daintier feet than the British, averaging 240mm
compared with 241.1mm in the UK (9.5 inches). German women average 242mm,
compared with 245mm for the Swedes and 242.1mm for the Americans.
The DTI has a less than exhaustive record of ring finger lengths, but on the
available evidence the British man's finger at 78.7mm (3.1 inches) is 1.7mm
longer than his German counterpart, but 0.2mm shorter than the American
average.
The British woman's ring finger at 72.6mm is 0.4mm smaller than her German
counterpart and 0.3mm smaller than the American.
Beverley Norris, research fellow at Nottingham university's institute for
occupational ergonomics, said the figures were useful for product designers.
The department has recently completed a study of the pulling force needed to
open ring pull cans.------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~-->

176,"Here's a weird and wacky problem:I'm currently out of the country with my trusty Evo N600c laptop. When I 
tried to use the serial port to talk to my mobile phone, Linux behaved 
pretty much as if the port was fried. Bizarre, I thought, because I'd 
used it successfully while in the office. The only difference was that I 
was trying the thing in the hotel. I entertained brief notions of having 
somehow fried the serial drivers, then rebooted the laptop to Windows 
and tried again. Worked perfectly. Back to Linux. Still not talking. 
Considered that it might be flaky power, so I ran the laptop on battery. 
Nope. Tried moving the laptop to a differnet part of the room where 
there might be less bogon flux. Still not working. Eventually I gave up 
and used the IrDA port instead - which is usually the serial connection 
of doom, grief, and teeth-grinding.This morning, in the office, the damn thing is working without a hitch.Anyone like to suggest what mystery technology is in use in the hotel 
that prevents serial ports from working under Linux?Cheers,
Waider.

from his account unless someone applies for claims asthe next  of kin to the
deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Unfortunately, neither
their

you can get these at freshrpms.net, except for gcc3, which you can find

the French is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur.""
Origins:   Yet another French fried ""George W. Bush is dumb""
story has been taken up by those who like their caricatures
drawn in stark, bold lines. According to scuttlebutt that
emerged in the British press in July 2002, President Bush,
Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair, and France's President
Jacques Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular,
the decline of the French economy. ""The problem with the
French,"" Bush afterwards confided in Blair, ""is that they don't
have a word for entrepreneur.""The source was Shirley Williams, also known as the Baroness
Williams of Crosby, who claimed ""my good friend Tony Blair"" had
recently regaled her with this anecdote in Brighton.Lloyd Grove of The Washington Post was unable to reach Baroness
Williams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he did
receive a call from Alastair Campbell, Blair's director of
communications and strategy. ""I can tell you that the prime
minister never heard George Bush say that, and he certainly
never told Shirley Williams that President Bush did say it,""
Campbell told The Post. ""If she put this in a speech, it must
have been a joke.""This is far from the first time Bush has been made the butt of
a jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less than
stellar intellectual abilities. Without straining our memories
too hard, we can come up with three other instances we've
chronicled on this site. In the summer of 2001, the joke of the
moment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in the
ranking of Presidential IQs, with George W. Bush being pegged
as the Chief Executive who scraped the bottom of the
intelligence barrel. In December 2000 it was a fake Nostradamus
quatrain which pontificated that the ""village idiot"" would win
the 2000 Presidential election. And in the spring of 2002, it
was the story of Bush's waving at Stevie Wonder that set folks
to chortling up their sleeves.Stories that illustrate this widely believed intellectual
shortcoming will always waft after George W. Bush because they
seemingly confirm what many already hold as true about this
public figure, that he's not the brightest fellow that's ever
been. It is human nature to revel in yarns that the hearer at
some level agrees with, thus tales of this sort will always
fall upon appreciative ears.Barbara ""ears of corn"" MikkelsonLast updated:   29 July 2002http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",Safe Email

either.Â  It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less
weight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another
miracle diet pill!""Â  Like you, I was skeptical at first, but

to lose except a lot of weight!Â  Let me tell you, it was
the best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,
as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds
to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
at all.Â  Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer
and received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount.Â I feel
the need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it
does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
I am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus'
absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED!If you are frustrated with trying other products, without having 
any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
then I recommend the only product that worked for me - 
'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how does this stuff
actually work?""Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which 
is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid 
weight loss. No ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just RESULTS!!! Here is the bottom line ...I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day.Â  
Just try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence 
to gain!Â  You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED.Â  This is my
pledge to you.BONUS! Order NOW & get FREE SHIPPING on 3 bottles or more!Â  To order Extreme Power Plus on our secure server, just click

Forwarded-by: ""Dave Bruce"" 
Forwarded by: Gary Williams A Mother had 3 virgin daughters. They were all getting married within a 
short time period. Because Mom was a bit worried about how their sex 
life would get started, she made them all promise to send a postcard 
from the honeymoon with a few words on how marital sex felt. The first girl sent a card from Hawaii two days after the wedding.  The 
card said nothing but ""Maxwell House"".  Mom was puzzled at first, but 
then went to the kitchen and got out the Nescafe jar. It said: ""Good till 
the last drop."" Mom blushed, but was pleased for her daughter. The second girl sent the card from Vermont a week after the wedding, 
and the card read: ""Benson & Hedges"".  Mom now knew to go straight to 
her husband's cigarettes, and she read from the Benson & Hedges pack: 
""Extra Long, King Size"".  She was again slightly embarrassed but still 
happy for her daughter. The third girl left for her honeymoon in the Caribbean.  Mom waited for 
a week, nothing. Another week went by and still nothing.  Then after a 
whole month, a card finally arrived.  Written on it with shaky 
handwriting were the words: ""British Airways"".  Mom took out her latest 
Harper's Bazaar magazine, flipped through the pages fearing the worst, 
and finally found the ad for the airline.  The ad said: ""Three times a 
day, seven days a week, both ways."" Mom fainted.

By Denis MuellerAt the end of World War II, the United States was a rigidly 
segregated country but there were cracks beginning to show. 
In 1946, the Supreme Court ruled that ruled that segregated 
seating on interstate transportation was illegal. In 1947, 
the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) decided to challenge 
the racist system. The opposition was fierce and the riders 
were jailed often ending up on chain gangs.By 1961, the time was right to challenge America's Jim Crow 
laws and CORE proposed the ""Freedom Rides."" CORE felt that 
they could count on the racists to oppose the rides thereby 
creating a crisis that would force the Federal Government to 
intervene to enforce the law. It would be dangerous and CORE 
members knew that they were risking their lives, but as CORE 
director James Farmer maintained they were ready.  ""When we 
began the ride I think all of us were prepared for as much 
violence as could be thrown at us. We were prepared for the 
possibility of death.""

south they met no resistance but by the time they got to 
Alabama they were met by an angry band of terrorists who 
slashed the tires and burned the bus. In Birmingham it was 
worse. The FBI, through its informant James Rowe, were well 
aware that the Ku Klux Klan was waiting for them. So were 
the Birmingham police, led by Chief of police Bull Conner, 
and when they arrived they were severely beaten. Despite the warnings there were no police to protect them. 
Governor Patterson showed no mercy and blamed the riders. 
So the terrorist attacks went on. The ""Freedom Riders"" were 
determined to continue and were joined by a group of Nash-
ville students. They were met by hostility and were arrested 
and sent back to Tennessee. But the riders were fearless and 
immediately returned to Birmingham ready to continue the 
journey.------------------------------------------------------------    ---------> The Paranormal Insider Is Here! <---------ShagMail is PROUD to introduce our one and only paranormal

""Freedom Riders"" left Birmingham on May 20th determined to 
continue. State officials had promised Attorney General Robert 
Kennedy they would be protected, but by the time they reached 
Montgomery there were no state police in sight. Seeing a mob, 
the riders feared for their lives, but Jim Zwerg, a white man, 
bravely walked out of the bus and was nearly beaten to death. 
He still suffers from the effects but his courage was un-
deniable. Others including Justice Department official John 
Seigenthaler were also beaten.The situation seemed to be out of control and federal inter-
vention finally saved the day with Governor Patterson declar-
ing martial law. Robert Kennedy called for a cooling off 
period but the riders refused. They would continue on. So 
they set off to Jackson, Mississippi but  Kennedy had made a 
deal with Mississippi officials. They were supposed to be 
protected, but upon arriving they were arrested. Kennedy had 
caved in. It was a cowardly decision by the Attorney General 
and the riders were sentenced for 60 days for exercising 
their constitutional rights. They never finished their trip 
but their courage showed the power of civil disobedience and 
in the end justice would prevail and terrorism would be 
defeated. It is another example of how people change things, 
not government officials.Sources: Eyes on the Prize------------------------------------------------------------

 Try installing the latest Perl (at least 5.6.1) port on Freebsd and make
sure you set the system to use perl from ports (i.e. in the
ports/lang/perl5/files directory run ./use.perl port. Reinstall the relevant
perl modules needed by razor and try again.Sven-------------------------------------------------------

272,"Uh, WWII Enigma was cracked at Bletchly Park, based on the work of some 
Poles, who had been trying to figure out when they would be invaded.   
Entirely mechanical!   Definitely not optical at all.    Enigma was 
originally broken based on bad use practice.  If it had been employed more 
sensibly it would have been a lot harder.See ""The Code Book"" by Singh, Doubleday, 1999.     Or, for that matter, 
""Cryptonomicon"" by Stephenson, which is a fictionalization of the Enigma 
cracking story, and pretty accurate.I eventually get born as a side-effect of the Battle of Britain, you 
see....Computing with interference patterns, etc, makes perfect sense, but Enigma 
was cracked by building mechanical systems that were essentially Enigma 
machines and brute-forcing.Eirikur

I wouldn't say that the societies of humans here before European occupancy
was 'lifted' by free xyz. Perhaps 'replaced' or 'sunk' or some other
description, but not 'lifted'. Also, the lifestyle of the remnants of those

directly compared, because I changed the methodology.  In 2.40 the scores
were evolved on the entire corpus, then evaluated using that corpus; ie.
there was no ""blind"" testing, and the scores could overfit and still
provide good statistics.In 2.42, they're evaluated ""blind"", on a totally unseen set of messages,
so those figures would be a lot more accurate for real-world use.--j.",Safe Email

329,"amta workshop on embedded mt systems - cfp workshop announcement - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - workshop on embedded mt systems call for papers design , construction , and evaluation of systems with an mt component wednesday , october 28 , 1998 ( preceding the amta 98 conference ) sheraton bucks county hotel , langhorne , pennsylvania introduction as the strengths and weaknesses of machine translation ( mt ) engines have become better understood and accepted , there has been a marked increase in the development of computer systems with anembedded mt component . one consequence of this shift to "" embedded mt "" is that researchers , developers , as well as users have begun pushing the limits on the input that such systems will accept for translation . in so doing , a new class of problems has surfaced : any input - - - whether it appears in physical form on paper , in electronic form on-line , or mixed in with another modality such as graphics or video - - - will bring with it some unknown mix of noisy natural language data as well as non-linguistic data . how are systems with an mt component to be designed and evaluated given the challenge this input brings ? the objective of this workshop is to examine and evaluate techniques for adjusting this "" linguistic impedance mismatch "" between the real-world input and the natural language input expected by various mt engines . thus the workshop will focus on computational approaches to preprocessing system input for mt engines andon statistical methods for evaluating systems with an embedded mt component . linguistic preprocessing in image data for researchers working with image data , there is currently underway an effort to augment ocr ( optical character recognition ) engines with linguistic data as they recognize and convert bitmap data into characters - - - similar to what has already been done in speech recognition with linguistic data in hmms ( hidden markov models ) . other ocr researchers have also experimented with image-level early topic detection using word-shape recognition . in principle , this could provide a first-step filtering of documents into a more homogeneous mt input set , a desirable goal for mt evaluation . thus we expect that individuals working with or intending to incorporate ocr into their computer systems will be interested in this new area . linguistic preprocessing in online data for those working with online input , even though the characters are already present , there often still remains the task of preprocessing meaningful , symbolic character strings that are not a part of the text to be translated . for some systems , the rules for identifying and encapsulating or removing such strings may need to be hand-crafted over time as mt engine limitations surface . for others , a combination of hand-crafted rules and statistically trained nl models has worked . many have observed that the html annotations , alphanumeric items , spreadsheet and word processing codes are harder to weed out than originally expected . research efforts with the low-density and less-commonly taught languages , as well as more common ones , encounter a substantial problem with variation in spelling conventions and transcription preferences . for those natural languages that are primarily spoken and not written , for example , this is frequently the case . researchers working on this class of problem have built variants on spell checkers ( sc ) , components that standardize words to one orthography ( spelling convention ) before submitting it to an mt engine . an idea that has arisen for this component is to build in an option to adjust the level of sc correction - - - as would be relevant when input after ocr nonetheless varies from very noisy to relatively clean . evaluation of embedded mt systems among those working on statistical methods for evaluating systems with an embedded mt component , we have seen two distinct trends . one group of statisticians has begun looking for appropriate models from outside the world of mt evaluation , examining the efforts by others to take distinct metrics for components and combine them for an overall system-level metric using fuzzy mathematics . another group of researchers is looking instead at developing a one-dimensional scale for ranking mt engines along a continuum defined by system-level function . that approach , for example , might rank one engine as good enough for filtering documents , while another engine deemed more linguistically robust would be ranked higher because it could generate a good enough initial translation for subsequent post-editing . we welcome other functional evaluations of mt components and computer systems with embedded mt components as well . submissions submitters are invited to send in a short paper , not more than 5 pages , addressing one or more of the three areas discussed above . papers should define the problem in an embedded mt system that is the focus of the work , describe the embedded mt system design ( a simple sketch ) with sample input data where relevant , and present their approach to the problem . work at various stages of completion is acceptable ; we expect the current status of the work to be made clear . submission of end-to - end output of an embedded mt system is especially encouraged . the papers will be collected and distributed to participants of theworkshop . ideally , the result of the workshop will be a clearer delineation of : ( 1 ) the range of linguistic preprocessing problems ( 2 ) the range of designs in embedded mt systems ( 3 ) how these problems aretreated in different embedded mt systems and ( 4 ) the metrics that are being used to evaluate these systems and their components . dates notice of interest in participation : july 10 , 1998 ( to voss @ arl . mil ) please identify which of the three areas you intend to address : preprocessing in image data , preprocessing in online data , evaluation of embedded mt systems . position paper submission : august 10 , 1998 notifications : september 10 , 1998 final copies of papers : october 10 , 1998 workshop : october 28 , 1998 submissions may be in printed or electronic form . submissions should be sent to : clare voss army research laboratory amsrl-is -

341,"basic word order this is a somewhat delayed reaction to frederick newmeyer 's posting on basic word order . i was prepared to let someone else comment on the underlying logic of newmeyer 's message . this did not happen , however , so here comes . newmeyer observes that data from a given language seldom exhibits an unambiguous ' basic word order ' , and there seem to be no generally agreed-upon criteria to resolve this ambiguity . he further notes that this fact reveals a weakness in functionalist linguistics ( or , in more polite terms , ' presents a challenge to it ' ) . he adds , on two occasions , that generative linguistics is increasingly coming to share the same weakness . by ` increasingly ' he must mean the fact that some applications of the principles-and - parameters approach are taking both language-particular and cross-linguistic data into account more seriously than used to be the case . before these developments , generative linguistics decreed that every ( configurational ) language has some sort of basic word order , as specified by the phrase structure ( or x - bar ) component of its grammar . newmeyer seems to suggest that this type of basic word order did not share the weakness that is ' increasingly ' becoming a characteristic of generative linguistics . the difference between earlier generative linguistics and current generative linguistics , and between their respective conceptions of basic word order , resides in the fact that the former did not , whereas the latter does , pay systematic attention to ( cross - ) linguistic data . newmeyer 's formulation then seems to suggest that not paying attention to ( cross - ) linguistic data is a strength of the theory . esa itkonen",Safe Email

Marc -- Since perl itself is a scripting language, and allows code to be eval'ed,
I can't see why we need to go the whole hog and implement another
turing-complete scripting language in perl.Let's go back to *why* this would be useful.  As far as I can see, you're
proposing this to deal with multi-match rules.  There's already a tracker
in the bug DB for these, with a proposed implementation.  http://www.hughes-family.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47I think this might have stalled due to shortcomings in the existnig
proposal, so I've just added my own thoughts on how to implement them. ;)
Comments on the proposed system would be welcome folks.... reply to the
bug db.--j.--

) - does the signer get the audiences attention ? ) - is the story well structured ? ) - is the story within the time limits set ( usually 3 minutes ) ? ) - does the signer keep to the rules ? ) this usually consists of - no dirty jokes . ) - no overzealous religious contexts . ) ) the competitior must give a title to his / her story and state its type , ( ie true ) story , joke story , sad story , not true story etc . . . ) ) ) if the story exceeds the time limit a point is deducted . however the signer is ) not interrupted if he / she exceeds the limit but is allowed to complete the ) story ( unless it really is too long ! ! ! ) . ) ) sometimes , at the end the winner ( if he / she is popular with the audience is ) asked to repeat it or give another story ) . ) ) . . . sign-singing is not too common among the deaf community far as i am ) aware . it is mostly done in religious situations . i think it is n't a strong ) component of deaf culture . however story-telling is a strong part of deaf ) culture and especially of making jokes and light-hearted teasing . anyway thats ) my deaf experience here in new zealand . ) from karina bingham ( karina @ uhunix . uhcc . hawaii . edu ) : ) there is an african - american a cappella group called "" sweet honey in the ) rock "" who have a full-time signer in the group . she performs with them and ) signs her interpretations of the songs . they recently published a book ) for their 25th anniversary : ) ) reagon , bernice johnson . the long journey home . 1994 . ) ) in which the signer discusses her experiences in the deaf community and ) a deaf church ( where the congregation sang in sign ) . her parents were both ) deaf ; she is not . ) from marina mcintire ( mmcintir @ lynx . dac . neu . edu ) : ) you have inadvertently touched upon a very tender issue in the deaf ) community here in the us . first , let me say that only in the us have i ) seen this phenomenon . brits ( both deaf and hearing who work with them ) ) are confounded and amused by it . in the us , it used to be quite the ) thing to translate songs and develop routines to go with them , produce ) recitals and concerts , and the like . it arose , most likely , out of a ) strong church-related tradition of "" helpers "" for deaf people . ) ) in the last ten to fifteen years , however , deaf people have begun their ) own liberation . song - signing has been a casualty , by and large . it is ) viewed as representing one aspect of a pathological or clinical view of ) deafness , i . e . , that the worst "" loss "" resulting from deafness is music . ) this is , of course , far from the truth . and for culturally deaf people , ) music is a peculiarity belonging to the mainstream hearing world and of ) no consequence in their lives whatsoever . so * that * motive ( helping ) d / deaf people appreciate what they ' re missing ) is not acceptable . ) ) another complaint is that , by and large , translations are more ) influenced by the rhythm of the music than by any sense it might make in ) asl , presenting d / deaf audiences with nonsensical or distorted versions ) of signs and signed syntax . this arises partly , of course , out of the ) difficulty of translating any poetry into any language . ) ) worst of all , and perhaps most puzzling to d / deaf people , is the ) insistence of most song-signers on including things like "" tra la la "" or ) humming . there is * nothing * that could make less sense to a d / deaf ) audience ! ) ) i will say that i have seen some wonderful song-sign translations done , ) including some with rather elegant dance routines . sometimes these have ) been done by d / deaf people and sometimes by hearing folks . by and large , ) however , this practice is no longer an acceptable pasttime in our ) community . exceptions are made , ironically , for interpreters who work in ) theater . musical productions , because of their general inclusion of ) dance ( a more interesting visual event ) and costume / props / etc . . . are ) quite popular and well-attended ( comparatively speaking ) by d / deaf ) theatre-goers . many thanks to all those who replied . randy lapolla institute of history and philology academia sinica",Safe Email

Betamax video recorders are finally being phased out almost 20 years after
losing the battle for dominance of the home video market to VHS. 
Betamax's manufacturer, Sony, has announced that it will make only 2,000
more machines for the Japanese market. They have not been on sale in the rest of the world since 1998.  
VHS became the dominant format by the mid-1980s
 
Betamax was launched in 1975, and won many fans who said it was better
quality than its VHS rival. Some 2.3 million Betamax machines were sold worldwide in its peak year,
1984, but it soon went downhill as VHS became the format of choice for the
film rental industry and in homes. Just 2,800 machines were sold in the 12 months to March 2002. ""With digital machines and other new recording formats taking hold in the
market, demand has continued to decline and it has become difficult to
secure parts,"" Sony said in a statement. Sony said it would continue to offer repairs and manufacture tapes for the
format. The professional Betamax format, Betacam, is still widely used in the
television and film industries and will be unaffected. But the recent rise of DVDs seems to have put the final nail in the coffin
for Betamax home players. In the 1980s, many video rental chains preferred the VHS format. Betamax lovers became so passionate about the format in the face of
competition from VHS that they set up the Betaphile Club in 1988. The picture and sound quality of Beta was superior to VHS, Betaphiles say,
although VHS tapes had a longer duration. A total of 18 million Betamax machines were sold around the world, but no
new ones will be made after the end of 2002. Sony is now planning to focus its efforts on new digital technologies.

Here is what our customers are saying about the Temple â€œ3â€ Ragga Dagga (TM) phenomenon:â€œTo whom it may concern,I was skeptical when I first read your ad.  I grew up in the 70â€™s & 80â€™s.  I was a hard core (alternative smoker) then.  So I knew my stuff.  But drug tests stopped that!  Now I am disabled from a degenerative muscle, ligament, and tendon disease.  I was smoking (an illegal product) for the pain and nausea.  Now I have something just as good; Temple 3, but cheaper, and it is legal!  I also have a lot of trouble sleeping, but the Capillaris Herba made into tea works and smells great!  Your products that I tried so far, are as good or better than your ads say!  That is hard to find nowadays in a company.  Who ever put this stuff together is a botanical genius.  I will be a customer for life!  Also, I talked with a lady on the phone when I was ordering, and asked her to find out if I could get my products and samples to hand out for free.  And just send the customers to you.  Or get a discount on products that I could sell retail to people.  I would prefer the earlier one becau!
se, I can just talk about your products, I am a great salesman (about 10 years experience), I could hand out flyers, give out little 1 gram pieces as samplers with your business card enclosed, etc.. I am going to be unable to work a regular job for a while, maybe indefinitely?  This deal would give me my own products and samples for free?  You would get free advertising, word of mouth, samples into peoples hands to try, someone that is very good with computers, someone who studied about mail order, Internet, cold calling, small business, good with people, etc..  I would like to be doing something, even if I would get on Social Security Disability.  It is very disheartening not being able to work to support my 2 teenage boys, or do a lot of the things I used to do!  At least I would be able to do something worthwhile.  And great products makes it real easy to sell.  Let me know what you think?Sincerely,RJâ€Location: Midwest, U.S.A.â€œThank you so much for the Ragga.  It is everything you guys claim, and then some!  I was a bit skeptical when I read your description of its effects, but there is literally no exaggeration in your advertisements.  How nice that this is non-prohibited!  It tastes great and feels great too!  I am so glad I took a chance and ordered.  Blessings to all of you.â€-- Frankie R.Location: West Coast, USAâ€œIâ€™m a man of my 40â€™s and I really know my stuff.  I donâ€™t drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path.  I used to have to take Valium in the past.  Not anymore with the Temple â€œ3â€.  It really amazes me how this stuff tastes like the Lebanese and blonde stuff I used to smoke in the 70â€™s.  I am very satisfied with all of your products.  I like them a lot and will be a customer for life for sure.  Whoever makes this stuff is an ARTIST at it.  Who would have thought?!â€  -- A.J.Location: United Kingdom

392,"re : summary : ' no ' and ' man ' thanks for all the responses . it was really something to get the number and quality of ideas . 1 . ' no ' my initial query was : south african english use of ' no ' - does this occur in contexts such as : a . how are you ? b . no , i ' m fine . in other english varieties / other languages ? confronted with such examples , vistors to the country often comment that in sa english , ' no ' means ' yes ' . this , of course , is not true . ' no ' would be the response to the question ' do you have the time ? ' if the speaker did n't have the time . * generally : a couple of people commented that ' no ' definitely does not mean ' yes ' in these contexts . what it does is rather to negate the possibility of a negative belief concerning the answer to the question . in the example above , for instance , b . is negating a . 's possible belief that b . is not well . why south africans hold that the possibility of such negative beliefs is so strong they have to be denied remains to be seen . * ' no ' in other varieties of english the use of ' no ' in the types of examples cited anyway is not recorded according to the responses in : - australian english - american english - english english it is recorded in : - nigerian and ghanaian english there do appear to be related ( but not identical ) discourse uses of ' no ' and similar particles in other varieties of english . few english responses actually dealt with this usage at all . by far the majority were on ' man ' * ' no ' in other languages ' no ' does seem to be used in a variety of other languages in the same way as in sa english . similar uses are recorded in : - the scandinavian languages - german ( 'd och ' - similar but not identical ) - cameroon french - bangkok thai ( ' plaw ' - lit . ' empty ' ) - spanish ? it also occurs , incidentally , in afrikaans . 2 . ' man ' my question here related to the use of ' man ' to express a negative emotional involvement of the speaker of some sort - irritation , impatience or annoyance . examples given were : man it 's hot today hurry up mom , man man , i can't this right * english a huge response that showed that ' man ' is used similarly in : - american english ( both ' black ' and ' white ' ) - scottish english - tyneside english ( in north east of england ) - jamaican english - welsh english - an ' americanism ' found in other varieties of english . the american english usage at least does not necessary carry negative sentiment and is ' a more general tag . . . over which any kind of emotional intonation can be laid ' . example b . above , an example which typifies sa usage , was found to be odd ( ' wierd ' ) by american respondants . the reason for this is that ' man ' although an interjection still appears to ' have the flavour of a term of address so that ' mom , man ' sounds like two forms of direct address in a row ' . it seems , then , that ' man ' in sae does not bare the feature ' term of address ' at all in such contexts . the only instance in which similar usages were given was in tyneside english . ( ' shut up man geoff ' ' those kegs are too tight man mary ' . here though , the actual term of address occurs finally as opposed to the use of ' man ' finally in sae . this needs to be explored further , but of further interest : - there is a distinctly ' american ' use of ' man ' in sae that is not like the south african use of man ( ' cool man ' type of utterances ) . - other sa examples of man : - daddy , man ! ( 5 year old daughter after i stood on her toe ) - man , david , i do n't mean that ( wife and self in ' altercation ' ) - no man , that 's not right . - man ! this bloody computer is giving problems . - saenglish ' man ' alternates between shwa and full vowel in all contexts . ( in sae shwa occurs as a vowel in stressed contexts - 's it ' can have shwa for eg ) : related usage in currant american english is the use of 'd ude ' . * other languages related uses of ' man ' include : - dutch - swedish ( ' boy ' is used in a similar way ) - norwegian - ? german use of ' etwa ' may have similar function - german ( ' usually to indicate weariness ' ) - spanish - ? lhasa tibetan ( ' mi ' - ' person ' ) interestingly in dutch the 'd ouble address form [ as in ' hurry up mom , man ' ] is impossible ( just "" schiet op , man "" must do ) . ' some interesting stuff came out as you can see . just for your interest , on further sa english item : - ' sorry ' for ' i beg your pardon ' e . g . a drops something without knowing . b picks it up and calls out to a ' sorry , you dropped something ' anyway thanks to : helen adamson geoffrey sampson elin haf gruffyd jones celso alvarez caccamo mai kuha mark donohue marek przezdziecki scott delancey mats eeg-olofsson dom watt hilde hasselgard nicole nelson jane a . edwards sren harder charlie rowe nobue mori adiego lajara bruce connell krisadawan hongladarom frank bramlett deborah milam berkley douglas s oliver larry trask kristine hasund paul boersma m . lynne roecklein judy l . delin benji wald stephen p . spackman john verhaar randall major + the person who wished to be anonymous for the references .",Safe Email

This recommendation is based on the information that you will not betray the trust and confidence to be reposed in you. I am Romila Kabila the second son of the assassinated former President Of Democratic Republic Of Congo (D.C) Late Laurent Desire Kabila who on Tuesday 16 January   during the four years rule of my father I was his confidential/private security and base on my position of relationship of father and son. I was able to be in change of the president's personal security vault and some of his savings.Now following the death of my father, the immediate family of the late President Kabila has met and concluded that some savings and security vault of the former President should be moved out of the troubled Democratic Republic of Congo with immediate president of Democratic republic of Congo by the late Kabila has been appointed president of democratic republic of Congo by the late kabila's national executive council and the country top military brass, and properties worth millions of US$ to relocate the late president kabila's assets and properties with millions of dollars  to over sea country where there is good political climate. We have concluded arrangement to move/transfer the sum US$42M to a finance and security company in London through a Diplomatic courier services. The family through a diplomatic contact during my father's regime, conclude an arrangement to lodge/deposit the above sums with the GLOBAL DIPLOMATIC AND SECURITY SERVICES in LONDON - U.K!
. And it is on this, that I am soliciting for your assistance to help us receive this amount from this security company once it arrives London upon your acceptance to assist in this project as we the family member can not do it on our own because of the code of conduct, which was introduced by my late father to checkmate excess embezzlement/siphoning of the Government/public funds overseas country as the case had be during the Late President Mobutu Sese Seko. So one cannot make law and destroy the same law. Therefore if you can render your assistance, please indicate your interest to me through my email romkabila@presidency.com, you should then urgently arrange to travel to London and clear the (consignments) funds upon it arrival and subsequent payment of the US$42M into your bank account. As soon as we hear from you, we then send a representative to be with you in London to represent our interest. Based on your anticipated efforts and contri!
bution the family has resolved to give you 20% commission and the remaining 80% will be reclaimed by the family. It will be my pleasure to be able to co-operate with you on terms that you may wish for the successful completion of this project. Thanks and remain blessed.Best Regards,

pretty much every version of gcc (2.95, 2.96, 3.0, 3.1, and the

Date: Not suppliedAfter discovering an open wireless net available from his sofa, Steven 
""Hackers"" Levy interviewed lawmen, academics and WiFi activists about the 
legality and ethics of using open wireless access points.     I downloaded my mail and checked media news on the Web. When I confessed 
    this to FBI agent Bill Shore, he spared the handcuffs. ""The FBI wouldn't 
    waste resources on that,"" he sniffed. Now I know that if it did, it would 
    be hard to argue that I broke a law. What's more, I certainly didn't feel 
    illegal. Becauseï¿½and this is the point of all that war-driving and 
    -chalking and node-stumblingï¿½when you get used to wireless, the experience 
    feels more and more like a God-given right. One day we may breathe 
    bandwidth like oxygenï¿½and arguing its illegality will be unthinkable.  Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Steven[3]!_)[1] http://www.msnbc.com/news/816606.asp

"" sources report that the sellers of these generator sets made this decision beginning approximately a week ago . additionally , sources believe that ge may move to cost - plus - based pricing for sellers of power in order to provide stable financing for generators over the long term , though this would mean less profits than in the past . pg & e executives profit even in bankruptcy as reported on 6 - 14 , sources continue to believe that socal executives are closely following the events unfolding in the pg & e bankruptcy case , as mentioned in last thursday ' s report "" judge montali approved large bonuses for pg & e senior management after pg & e ' s filing made bryson and other members of his team "" reconsider "" the merits of bankruptcy . "" today ' s news reports of judge montali ' s order providing pg & e executive with $ 17 . 5 m in bonuses just reiterates the point to bryson that pg & e executives remain well - paid even in bankruptcy thus suggesting socal could do equally well in the event of a filing . sources suggest that socal ' s current cash position weighs less heavily in determining a bankruptcy filing than the prospect of asset seizures / liens ( however , sources continue to make inquiries as to socal ' s cash flow situation . )",Safe Email

  | so I'll probably poke around at the sequences performance issues,Well, there's this wonderful piece of code in MhSeqExpand ...    # Hack to weed out sequence numbers for messages that don't exist
    foreach m $rseq {
        if ![file exists $mhProfile(path)/$folder/$m] {
            Exmh_Debug $mhProfile(path)/$folder/$m not found
            set ix [lsearch $seq $m]
            set seq [lreplace $seq $ix $ix]
        } else {
            # Real hack
            break
        }
    }which is going to run slow if a sequence happens to start with a bunch
of messages that don't exist.   I'm not sure why it is important that the
first message in the sequence returned exists, but not necessarily any
of the others, but I'm sure glad it is, as MhSeqExpand gets called lots,
and I don't know if I could cope if it were checking every file in the
sequences it is looking at, all the time...It may help to keep a list of the valid message numbers for the current
folder (though that would then need to be verified against changes to the
directory).   Does tcl have a directory read function?   I assume so...Mh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the
context file) but I'm not sure how frequently that one is called.  | I'll email anything I figure out since I'm leaving town in less 
  | than 48 hours.Have a good vacation.kre_______________________________________________
